## Project Status Model

I keep repos labeled so usage is clear:

- **Stable** – Used in real environments, documented, versioned.
- **In Progress** – Actively developed, safe to try, evolving.
- **Experimental** – Prototypes / labs / learning projects.
  
## Working Style

- Clear READMEs, real-world use cases.
- Prefer scripts and docs that a tech can run at 2am without guessing.
- Open to collaboration, feedback, and roles where this mindset fits.
